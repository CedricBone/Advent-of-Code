                              Description:

Advent of Code is an advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem-solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.

                              Challenges:

Day 1: Calorie Counting

Day 2: Rock Paper Scissors

Day 3: Rucksack Reorganization

Day 4: Camp Cleanup

Day 5: Supply Stacks

Day 6: Tuning Trouble

Day 7: No Space Left On Device
